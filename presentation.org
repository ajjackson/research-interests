** Oxidation of GaN - findings

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
   - Supercell size dependence: band-filling correction for dilute limit
   - ~1,000,000:1 N_{2} to O_{2} ratio needed to prevent oxidation
   - Paper published in /Phys. Rev. B/ [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.165201][10.1103/PhysRevB.88.165201]]

** CZTS

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
   - Copper zinc tin sulfide
   - Thin-film absorber layer for earth-abundant PV
   - p-type "copper-poor" material typically produced
   - Poor reproducibility between experimental groups
   - Major concerns are low open-circuit voltage and presence of secondary phases

** CZTS

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
   - Investigate relative stability of phases against $T$, $P$
   - Similar approach to GaN, more materials: /ab initio/ lattice dynamics
   - Initially looked at decomposition to binaries
   - → Sensitive to temperature, at low S pressure
   - Published in /J. Mater. Chem. A/ [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00892h][10.1039/c4ta00892h]]

Cu_{2}S + ZnS + SnS + S_{(g)} ⇌ Cu_{2}ZnSnS_{4}

** CZTS
   - Move to include ternary phases
   - Ternary phase diagrams with "open" sulfur content
   - Vary chemical potentials with two parameters:
     - temperature and pressure

** CZTS
   [[./images/phasediagram_multi.png]]

** CZTS

   - Found very narrow stability region for CZTS without CTS
   - Presented at conferences
   - Main finding of PhD thesis

** Sulfur

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
   - While developing CZTS stability models, found inconsistent treatment of sulfur
   - Known to consist of a mixture of allotropes
   - Typically one allotrope is assumed to represent vapour phase
   - Last model of mixture developed in 1970s, made a lot of assumptions

** Sulfur
   - Evolutionary algorithm used to generate candidate clusters,
     compared with literature
   - Used a selection to populate equilibrium model

** Sulfur
   - Vibrations computed with range of DFT XC functionals
   - PBE0 frequencies with 96% scale factor provided best fit
   - Create "universal" chemical potential of sulfur atoms accounting for equilibrium as $f(T,P)$
   - Paper published in /Chem. Sci./ [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C5SC03088A][10.1039/C5SC03088A]]

** High-throughput screening
   - Work in progress
   - Supporting code is being developed openly at http://github.com/wmd-group/smact
   - "Low-fi" chemical screening of arbitrary element combinations
     - Simple tight-binding models
     - Materials availability
     - Electronegativity rules
     - Radius ratios
   - Paper and conference talks in preparation


* Areas of interest

** Experiment interpretation and prediction

   - Quantitative prediction of Raman and IR results
     - Phonon-phonon interactions, DFPT and instrument corrections for CZTS
       - [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4917044][10.1063/1.4917044]]
     - Hybrid DFT pDOS for resonant Raman spectroscopy
       - Applied to Zn(S,Se) [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C5CP04498G][10.1039/C5CP04498G]]
   - PV device properties more difficult - but important!
     - $E_{g}$: Optics vs current/voltage vs V_{OC} vs computation
     - Device modelling

** Reproducible research & data sharing

   - Computational chemistry is deterministic! No excuses for
     difficulty reproducing work
   - Research councils require raw data to be made available
   - Go one step further by making all analysis available, e.g.
     http://github.com/wmd-group/sulfur_model
   - New databases of results are being developed (Materials Project, OQMD...)


* Wrapping up

   - Work so far has primarily used GGA/hybrid DFT with supercells
   - Keen to branch out in both directions
     - Low-cost forcefield calculations and embedded cluster calculations
     - Beyond-DFT methods for improved optical modelling
   - Automation is good...
     - as long as it is easy to understand
   - HPC is good...
     - as long as the results are useful
